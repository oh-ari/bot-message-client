# Discord Bot Message Client

A nice and simple way to message through your bot.

I locally-host my bot so it's easy for me to just create a messaging server on localhost:3000 and run it through that. I have done what I can to ensure it's simple enough for your own needs though.

Just ensure you have the requirements installed. 

## Planned:

- Server & Channel tab to select a channel yourself instead of having to include it in the message.
